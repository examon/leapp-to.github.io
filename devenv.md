# Setup your Leapp development environment

  Currently, Leapp tool is divided into multiple projects. This means that in order to setup
a development environment one has to setup everything piece by piece. At this point there are
basically two choices, either setup minimal viable environment which includes [*Snactor library*](#snactor),
[*Leapp daemon*](#daemon) and [*Leapp tool*](#leapp) which includes Cockpit UI plugin, or setup
a full fledged development environment which contains all the bits and pieces mentioned in section
[*2*](#repositories). The choice of which kind of environment should be setup depends on the needs.
However, the recommended one is the full fledged environment.
  In order to start the setup procedure, please follow all steps in section [1 - Prerequisites](#prereq)
since every step in the following section [*2*](#repositories) depends on it. Then you can proceed and
set up each required project. This should be again straigtforward process, as it requires following
each step mentioned in the project section.

  Because we realize that this is quite complicated and a rather tedious process, we prepared a [script](#bscript)
and a set of pre-prepared [images](#vagrant).

## <a name="prereq"></a>1. Prerequisites

#### Step 1) Enabling repositories containing the build & runtime libraries:

```shell
    sudo dnf copr enable evilissimo/leapp
```

#### Step 2) Installing the required tools:

```shell
    sudo dnf -y install git tito python2-pip
```

#### Step 3) Setting up a project root
```shell
    export LEAPP_HOME=$HOME/leapp
    mkdir -p $LEAPP_HOME
```

    tito build --install --verbose --rpm --test
```

#### Step 4) Setting up a testing environment - integration testing:

```shell
    cd $LEAPP_HOME/leapp

    sudo dnf -y install pipsi docker vagrant vagrant-libvirt
    sudo systemctl enable libvirtd
    echo "export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" >> $HOME/.bashrc
    export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH

    pipsi install pew
    pipsi install pipenv

## 3. Prepared images and bootsrap script

### <a name="vagrant"></a>3.1 Vagrant

  Please download [Vagrantfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leapp-to/leapp/master/dev-images/vagrant/Vagrantfile) from the leapp
repository. Then you can start your new instance of leapp development environment using following command executed
from the folder where the Vagrant file was downloaded:

```shell
    vagrant up
```

### 3.2 Docker
  Please download [Dockerfile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leapp-to/leapp/master/dev-images/docker/Dockerfile) from the leapp
repository. Once the file is downloaded, you can proceed with steps in section 3.2.1.

#### 3.2.1 Creating the container

  From the folder where the Dockerfile is located, run:

*Build the docker image and run it*

```shell
    docker build -t leapp-devenv .
    docker run --name leapp-devenv-instance -i -d -e container=docker \
        --tmpfs /tmp --tmpfs /run -v /sys/fs/cgroup/:/sys/fs/cgroup/:ro --privileged leapp-devenv
```

*Connect to the docker container*

```shell
    docker exec -ti leapp-devenv-instance /bin/bash -c "cd /root && exec \$SHELL"
```

*Watch the provisioning progress*

  The installation / provisioning process is being executed during the first start of the container. This is time consuming process
and you can watch the progress using:

```shell
    watch tail -n 30 /root/leapp-setup.log
```

*How to recognize the installation is done*

  If there was no error during the setup process, you should see following message at the end of the logs:

```
    Please run:

            exec /bin/bash

            or logout & login to finish the setup.

    Provisioning of development environment was completed
```

#### 3.2.2 Restarting the container

  The docker container is by design ephemeral. However, if you want to keep the changes and possibly return to your work after
you exited the container, you can restart it and reconnect to it using these commands:

```shell
    docker start leapp-devenv-instance
    docker exec -ti leapp-devenv-instance /bin/bash -c "cd /root && exec \$SHELL"
```

#### 3.2.3 Removing the container

  If you are done with your environment, you can simply remove the container by using this command:

```shell
    docker rm -f leapp-devenv-instance
```

### <a name="bscript"></a>3.3 Bootstrap script

#### Setting up a complete development environment

```shell
    curl -O https://leapp-to.github.io/files/build_leapp_environment.sh
    sh build_leapp_environment.sh
```

#### Setting up a minimal development environment

```shell
    curl -O https://leapp-to.github.io/files/build_leapp_environment.sh
    sh build_leapp_environment.sh minimal
```

***NOTE***: Please be aware that you will need sudo privileges and the script may alter your $HOME/.\*rc file
